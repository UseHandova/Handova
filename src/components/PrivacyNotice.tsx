Rent is held in an escrow smart contract on the Arc blockchain until the tenant moves in. Handova decides how your data is used, so we are responsible for it under the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023.</p>

        <h2 className={h2} style={{ color: 'var(--ink)' }}>Why we're allowed to use it</h2>
        <ul className={`${p} list-disc pl-5 space-y-1`}>
          <li><b>To provide the service you asked for:</b> your account, listings, bookings, chats and payments.</li>
          <li><b>Your consent:</b> ownership documents, and WhatsApp messages you choose to send us. You can withdraw consent at any time.</li>
          <li><b>Preventing fraud:</b> identity checks and the ID fingerprint that stops one person running many accounts.</li>
          <li><b>The law:</b> if we're legally required to keep or share something.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className={h2} style={{ color: 'var(--ink)' }}>Who else handles it</h2>
        <p className={p}>We use these services to run Handova. Each only gets what it needs for its job:</p>
        <ul className={`${p} list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2`}>
          {SHARED.map(([who, what]) => <li key={who}><b>{who}</b>: {what}</li>)}
        </ul>
        <p className={`${p} mt-2`}>Some of these services are outside Nigeria, so your data may be processed abroad. We only use providers that protect it.</p>

        <h2 className={h2} style={{ color: 'var(--ink)' }}>The blockchain is public and permanent</h2>
        <p className={p}>Payments, listing details and the "verified" flag are recorded on the Arc blockchain. Anyone can see them, and nobody, including us, can change or delete them. We can hide a listing inside Handova, but it stays on the blockchain. Please don't put personal details you want to stay private in a listing description.</p>

        <h2 className={h2} style={{ color: 'var(--ink)' }}>How we keep it safe</h2>
        <p className={p}>Access to private data needs your signed-in session, and only the people in a booking or chat can see it. Ownership documents are encrypted while stored. We take an encrypted backup of our database every day and keep each one for 14 days, so something you ask us to delete may stay in a backup for up to 14 days before it's gone for good. Ownership documents are never included in backups.</p>

        <h2 className={h2} style={{ color: 'var(--ink)' }}>Your rights</h2>
        <p className={p}>Under the Nigeria Data Protection Act you can ask us to: see the data we hold about you, correct it, delete it (except what's on the blockchain), stop using it for a purpose you object to, or give you a copy to take elsewhere. You can withdraw consent at any time. We'll reply within 30 days. If you're unhappy with our answer, you can complain to the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC).</p>

        <h2 className={h2} style={{ color: 'var(--ink)' }}>Contact us</h2>
        {CONTACT
          ? <p className={p}>For any privacy question or request, contact <a href={/@/.test(CONTACT) ? `mailto:${CONTACT}` : CONTACT} className="underline" style={{ color: 'var(--accent)' }}>{CONTACT}</a>.</p>
